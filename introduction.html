            <p>Introduction to The History of Video Games</p>
            <p class="content">Once upon a time there did exist a world without video games. Like so many things distinctly human, electronic games were born out of a combination of innovation, necessity and curiosity. Early tinkerers made electronic amusements, cheap, crude entertainment that would transform in time to something potent and alive. This would not just happen by electronic wizardry, but by the endeavors of artists, designers, and entrepreneurs, whose initial goal to entertain also came to challenge, captivate, and enlighten millions of people around the world. The men and women who created this industry allowed their own experiences and the world around them to inform their creations. This is the history of video games.</p>
