                <h4>Article about the beginning of change in video games</h4>
                <section class="col-2-1">
                <p class="content">Others argue that electronic games began much earlier or that video games were a byproduct of Cold War technology. As usual, the truth is somewhere in the middle. While many industries and innovators combined to pave the way even for the possibility of the first video game, there is little argument as to the visionaries and the company that finally brought video games to the public… in a big way, the Atari game system. Nolan Bushnell brought to Atari the understanding of what makes a good game. He played a lot of games and understood them. When they started, they found that the games that were most successful were those that were simple to learn, but impossible to master. Pong was somewhat of an accident. It was considered to be too simple, but a massively fun game. The coining of the phrase <em>video game</em> refers to an RGB, or red, green and blue raster or <em>video</em> display device. Let’s take Pac-Man for example, the original. You can see the bitmap image of Pac-Man. When enlarged, individual pixels appear as squares. Zooming in further, they can be analyzed, with their colors constructed by adding the values for red, green, and blue. A bitmap corresponds <em>bit-for-bit</em> with an image displayed on a screen. A bitmap is technically characterized by the width and height of the image in pixels and by the number of bits per pixel, or a <em>color depth</em>, which determines the number of colors the pixel and ultimately the image can represent.</p>

                <p class="content">The more bits, the better the games looked. More bits, however, meant more memory was needed, which was in short supply in the early days of gaming. This resulted in games that looked blocky and simple. But that didn’t stop designers and gamers from diving headlong into this amazing new medium. Over time and as technology advanced, 8 bits became 16, then 32, 64, 128, and so on. With each generational jump in graphics and so called <em>image fidelity</em>, the depth of story and immersion in games seemed to progress as well. The technological limitations drove the art form and vice versa. Games were slowly evolving, and those on the inside were growing up with the very art form they were creating. Probably the most memorable console of anyone’s life is the Nintendo Entertainment System. The reason we get nostalgic about things is it’s not necessarily the thing that we were doing. It’s not the song, it’s not that game, or that movie, or that book, it’s what was happening in your life at that time. Nintendo hit at exactly the right time in a lot of people’s life. And the NES then was an amazing, amazing game system. Games got better fast. Before most made it to their teens, everything did not look as great as the games did ion the arcade. But by the time Nintendo came out, things started getting a lot better.</p>

                <p class="content">The video game industry changed forever once again when the PlayStation 1 and Nintendo 64 Entertainment systems came to life with the introduction to 3D game models. What this allowed the vision of Mr. Miyamoto to do was to say now that I have the ability to manipulate polygons in real time at a fast enough frame rate, then instead of just going back and forth, now I can run around in circles, or move into or out of the screen. So it brought a whole new dimension to the gameplay. And the controller was actually designed with an analog joystick to be able to control that movement. This started to add a whole new dimension into what gamers were used to. And so, for a long time, it had been this 2D, sort of parallaxing 2D planes. But as you sort of moved into that 3D era, you started to see people start to play with, you know, what are the kinds of mechanics we can do now&#63; What are the things that we can actually play with&#63; What’s this new world of this other dimension&#63; And so, it was painful at first. Certainly, there were good examples of it while growing up, but it was hard. It’s hard to give the players this whole other level of freedom that they weren’t used to. And then we started getting consoles that were bigger and better, and you could bring in more of a 3D environment with better frame rate and better sound. Then you could put more polygons on the screens so the guys could look more realistic.</p>
