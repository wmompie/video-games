            <blockquote><a class="peter" href="https://rpgwatch.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-2924.html" target="_blank">&#34;The trouble is with art is it’s a subjective term. You know, one person’s art is another person’s rubbish. And this is where you come back to the semantics of the word <strong><em>art</em></strong> which is problematic. Whether that is a film, or whether that is a book, or whether that is a painting, or whether that is a computer game, it elicits a response. It makes you think about the world or look at the world in a slightly different way.&#34;</a><br><br><cite>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;Peter Molyneux &#40;Industry Pioneer&#41;</cite></blockquote>

                <p class="content">Finally, with the PlayStation and PlayStation 2, you started to see some really interesting stuff happening. You started to get avatars on screen that were more representative of people. They’re easier to understand what they were trying to make you go through. Especially on the PlayStation 2, it started to feel like we have enough graphics to really render interesting people. You’d know they weren’t real, but they were real enough. And so, you could sort of start to believe in them more. And then when we got to the PlayStation 3, they started thinking &#34;Okay, this thing’s gonna give us enough power to really go back and revisit that idea of telling an interesting, character-driven narrative in a way that we might be able to do that no one’s done before.&#34; With the continuous waves of technical and artistic changes sweeping over the industry and games getting better and bigger, the video game industry began to anchor itself within the public consciousness, many starting to argue that games are as much of an art form as… anything.I’ve always believed that games are absolutely an art form. As <cite>Phil Fish</cite> said, &#34;it’s the culmination of every form of art and expression that mankind has ever had goes into a game&#34;. You look at the staff that builds</p>

                <p class="content">a video game. You have a music composer. You have a writer. You have an artist who does sketch work. You have a technical artist. You have level designers who create spaces much like architects. It really is kind of the Avengers of talent when you really think about it. Nowhere is it more obvious than in video games. You have these artists creating these beautiful three-dimensional worlds. And the technology allowing players to come into those worlds and have them be as real as possible is the ultimate example of art and science working together. The best description of art is that art is somebody who’s put together something that deliberately provokes a response in an audience. The consumer actually is a participant in the art. It’s almost like being part of a great art experiment about a living art experiment. Yes, there is a lot of basic logistics such as you push &#34;X&#34; and this happens, or you push &#34;up&#34; and that happens. But if that’s all games were, we wouldn’t be playing them anymore. We would have lost interest a long, long time ago. Surprisingly, Modern game technology Is still based on the same fundamental concept of early game tech, combining new layers of science and art to reach higher levels of innovation and expression.</p>
