                <p class="content">What about rating game content&#63; Over 85&#37; of parents are aware of the ESRB rating system which rate a game’s content and match it with the appropriate gaming age. E for Everyone, T for Teen, M for Mature. But the question on a lot of minds is, do parents really control what their kids play&#63; Over 73&#37; of parents believe that the parental controls available in all new video game consoles are useful. Further, parents impose time usage limits on video games more than any other form of entertainment. Over 90&#37; of the time, parents are present when games are purchased or rented, and 82&#37; of the time children receive their parents’ permission before purchasing or renting a game. Much like movies, games have specific genres and sub-genres such as action, adventure, role playing, casual games, shooters, strategy games, open world versus linear games, sports games, racing games. The list goes on and on, and each genre offers its own special mix of interactive entertainment. And yes, each is wildly successful in its own way. In the past decade, video games have gone from a 6 billion to an over &#36;24 billion annual industry, far surpassing movies and music. The bottom line&#63; Video games are here, and they are here to stay.</p>
